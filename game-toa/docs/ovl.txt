Tales of the Abyss OVL - OVL is a dynamical loaded slice of executable to avoid loading ALL code at once (wasting unnecesary memory).

There are 4 OVL modules in USA version:

OV_PDVD_BTL_US.OVL    - Module loaded in battles
OV_PDVD_FIELD_US.OVL  - Module loaded in world map
OV_PDVD_SFD_US.OVL    - Module loaded to play movies
OV_PDVD_SKIT_US.OVL   - Module loaded when playing skits

Modules are cached so they don't have to be loaded each time.

They all loads at reserved address 0x64B880
EXE starts at 0x57ADA0
